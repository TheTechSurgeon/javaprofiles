# ![Milkman Logo](img/milk-bottle.png) Milkman - An Extensible Request/Response Workbench

Milkman is heavily inspired by Postman. But I got sick of all those electron-based applications that need ages and loads of memory to start up.
Therefore i created a JavaFx-based workbench for crafting requests / responses. It is not limited to e.g. http (or more specifically rest) requests. Due to nearly
everything being a plugin, other things are possible, like database-requests or GRPC, GraphQl, etc...

## :exclamation::exclamation: Update on Insomnia

Hello Insomnia Users :wave:. Recently, a way to [import insomnia data](docs/features.md#insomnia-import) was added due to the [latest changes](https://github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues/6577) on insomnia. 
Rest assured that the restriction of having an account in Postman (and now, Insomnia) was one of the main reasons to create Milkman and
such a thing will never ever happen. \
The importer will be available in version 5.7.0 but is already implemented in the [nightly release](https://github.com/warmuuh/milkman/workflows/Nightly/badge.svg?branch=master).

# Existing Plugins:

*Note: see respective plugin folder for more details*

### [Http Request Plugin](/milkman-rest): (included in main distribution)
The Http request plugin packaged with the release contains all means to do http request as well as import collections, environments or dumps from postman or insomnia.
To migrate from postman, just [export a dump-file from postman](https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/postman/collections/data_formats/#data-dumps) and import it by pasting its content into the `Postman (v2.1) Dump`-Importer. \
To migrate from insomnia, see [docs](docs/features.md#insomnia-import).
The Http Request Plugin also comes with Proxy-support. Some proxies require credentials and support for supplying `BASIC` proxy credentials is built into the plugin. See Options-page to activate that as it is off by default.
Additionally, the plugin supports chunked responses, enabling testing of Server-sent events ([SSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events)).

# Plugins

No client fits all, so you are **encouraged** to write your own plugins to e.g. add headers that are necessary for your internal service structures or add importers for internal service registries.

A [sample plugin](https://github.com/warmuuh/milkman/tree/master/milkman-note) was provided that extends all requests with a `Note` tab so you can add some description to any kind of requests.

More details about developing plugins can be found in the [plugin development guide](/docs/plugin-development.md).

*Installation:* all plugins are to be copied to the `/plugins` folder (or via [plugin-management](/milkman-plugins-management), since version 5.8.0)
