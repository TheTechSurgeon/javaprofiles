# Milkman Plugin Management

This plugin is meant to give the end-user the capability to easily install milkman plugins already downloaded to their local machine. Additionally, the user can
easily remove existing plugins they don't want to use anymore.

## Usage

The plugin management can be reached via the Milkman's `Settings` dialog under the entry `Plugins`.

### Installing Plugins

Click the Add button and choose the plugin file in the open dialog. After installation, Milkman has to be restarted.

### Uninstalling Plugins

All currently installed plugins are shown in the table. Find the plugin you don't want to use anymore and click the `X` button.
